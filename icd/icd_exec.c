/**
 @mainpage Internet Connectivity daemon version 2

 Responsibilities of the different components
 --------------------------------------------
 Responsibility of establishing a network connection is divided between
 the connectivity library, ICd with its modules and the UI.
 The connectivity library used by the application creates a D-Bus request
 and sends it to ICd. ICd processes the request and invokes the UI when
 necessary. After network connection establishment the connectivity
 library is informed with the outcome of the network establishment.

 The UI can also be invoked without interaction from the connectivity
 library. In such cases the 'Select connection' dialog is requesting ICd
 to provide it with and updated view of available networks. ICd will
 provide the UI with an up to date view of the networks. It is up to the
 UI design whether service level ("hotspot") connections are shown with
 the associated physical networks or whether the service level connections
 are collapsed into one entry only. From the displayed connections the
 user selects one which the UI requests ICd to try to establish. The
 connection request to ICd is done using the same methods as are
 available for the connectivity library.

 Internal structure
 ------------------
 ICd2 consists of the following components:

 - A request for a connection to be established is represented by an
   icd_request data structure. The request is created when the API calls
   the icd_request_new() function. The parameters for this function call
   are either taken from the scan results or by requesting one of the
   "any IAPs" (TBD).

   The request is passed to the policy API (TBD) that will add one or
   more candidate IAPs to the request data structure. When the policy has
   been satisfied, the candidate IAPs are tried one after another with
   the first successfully established IAP getting selected and any other
   IAPs removed from the candidate list.

   When the IAP has been disconnected, the request data structure is
   deleted.

   See also @ref icd_request.

 - The Internet Access Point (IAP) icd_iap data structure keeps state
   information of the network connection being created. The request code
   iterating through the list of candidate IAPs calls icd_iap_connect()
   for each candidate IAP in order to create one of them.
   The network connection creation attempt is started using the
   icd_iap_module_next(). Connection creation goes through the link_up,
   link_post_up and ip_up icd_nw_api functions in order.

   The status callback functions for each icd_nw_api level can report
   success in two ways, either with #ICD_NW_SUCCESS or
   #ICD_NW_SUCCESS_NEXT_LAYER. #ICD_NW_SUCCESS allows ICd to search for
   another network module with lower priority that also provides an *_up
   function for the same layer as the callback. With
   #ICD_NW_SUCCESS_NEXT_LAYER the module can force ICd to go directly to
   the next layer above the one whose callback just got called. When
   #ICD_NW_RESTART is reported, the IAP will close down and then
   immediately created again.

   Disconnecting an IAP happens when the status callback reports error or
   when the network module spontaneously needs to bring down a connection
   using icd_nw_close_fn(). The latter case is reserved for a connected
   IAP; while the IAP is being connected the callback is the preferred
   method for reporting an error event leading to disconnection. When
   disconnecting, link_down, link_pre_down and link_down icd_nw_api
   functions are called in reverse order for those modules whose
   respective _up functions got called on connect. Has the module not yet
   called the given callback when disconnect is started, the _down
   function for the respective level and module will be called.

   See also @ref icd_iap.

   @todo draw the IAP state diagram and insert it here

 - Any part of ICd interested in scan results registers a scan callback
   with icd_scan_results_request(). Scanned elements that already are in
   the cache will be received by the callback immediately. As new scan
   results appear, they will be provided to the callback. Expiry and
   updated results are also indicated, see the enum icd_scan_status.
   Scanning will go on as long as there is any listeners registered, the
   rescan interval and cache expiry are dictated by the corresponding
   module. A rescan will not be performed if there are no listeners when
   the rescan timer expires.
